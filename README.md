##Â Trente30

Trente30 is a very simple Android app to practice [interval training](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_training).

Trente is the French word for 30, and 30/30 is the most basic form of interval training.

I coded it because I did not find any simple app to give me intervals.  I do not need complicated apps, with community management or coach advices, and to not want to pay for a simple countdown.

## Contributing and translation

This is my first Android app.  I may have made lots of mistakes.  Comments and contributions are welcome.

Trente30 is now in English and in French.  Translations and corrections are welcome.
